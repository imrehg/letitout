# Let It Out

Based on a brainstorming session in our business discussion group,
here's something for purely just the fun of it

Take a picture or load a picture from somewhere, with people on them
and just "beat them up". Because sometimes you want to do that but
not in real life (maybe they are stronger or live too far to go there
and punch them).
